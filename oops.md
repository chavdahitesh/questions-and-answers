## OPPS CONCEPT

Here is a list of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in JavaScript with simple real-life examples:

1. Objects:
   Objects are instances of classes that encapsulate data and behavior.
   In real life, an object can be represented by a car. A car object would have properties like color, model, and methods like start, stop, and accelerate.

2. Classes:
   Classes are blueprints for creating objects. In real life, a class can be represented by a car manufacturer.
   The class would define the common properties and behaviors that all cars produced by that manufacturer would have.

3. Inheritance:
   Inheritance allows objects to inherit properties and methods from a parent class.
   In real life, we can think of a parent class as a generic vehicle class, and child classes like car, motorcycle, and bicycle inheriting properties and behaviors from the vehicle class.

4. Encapsulation:
   Encapsulation is the bundling of data and methods within an object.
   In real life, think of a bank account object that encapsulates the account balance and methods like deposit and withdraw.
   The data (account balance) is hidden from direct access and can only be manipulated through the defined methods.

5. Polymorphism: 
  Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as if they belong to a common parent class. 
  In real life, consider a music player that can play different types of media, such as songs, podcasts, or audiobooks. 
  The music player can have a play method that can accept any type of media object and play it accordingly.

6. Abstraction:
   Abstraction focuses on providing simplified interfaces to complex systems. In real life, think of a remote control for a TV.
   The remote control provides simple buttons like power, volume, and channel, abstracting the complex inner workings of the TV.

7. Method Overriding:
   Method overriding allows a child class to provide its own implementation of a method inherited from a parent class.
   In real life, consider a shape class with a calculateArea method. The child classes like rectangle and circle can override the calculateArea method to provide their own specific implementations.

These are some of the key OOP concepts in JavaScript, and understanding and implementing them can help in creating well-structured, reusable, and maintainable code.
