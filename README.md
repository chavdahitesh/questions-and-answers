## javascript closure

In JavaScript, a closure is a combination of a function and the lexical environment within which that function was declared. It allows a function to access variables from its outer (enclosing) scope even after the outer function has finished executing.
When a function is defined inside another function, the inner function has access to the variables and parameters of the outer function, as well as any variables declared in the global scope. This is possible because the inner function forms a closure over the outer function's scope, preserving access to its variables.

Here's an example to illustrate closures in JavaScript:

 ```javascript
    function outerFunction() {
      var outerVariable = 'Hello';

      function innerFunction() {
        console.log(outerVariable); // Accessing outerVariable from the outer scope
      }

      return innerFunction;
    }

    var closure = outerFunction();
    closure(); // Output: Hello
```
In the above example, `outerFunction` defines an inner function `innerFunction`. The inner function has access to the `outerVariable` declared in the outer function's scope. When `outerFunction` is called and the inner function is returned, a closure is created, preserving the access to `outerVariable`. The returned inner function is assigned to the variable `closure`, and when `closure` is called, it logs the value of `outerVariable` to the console.

Closures are powerful because they allow functions to maintain access to variables from their outer scope even when the outer function has finished executing. This enables functions to have private variables, create data privacy, and implement various design patterns like the module pattern.

Closures are commonly used in JavaScript for tasks like creating private variables, implementing currying, and handling asynchronous operations.


## Promise

-	A promise is an object that represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value. It is a way to handle asynchronous code in a more readable and manageable way.

In JavaScript, a promise can be in one of three states:

1. Pending: The initial state of a promise. It is neither fulfilled nor rejected.
2. Fulfilled: The state of a promise when the asynchronous operation is completed successfully. In this state, the promise returns a value.
3. Rejected: The state of a promise when the asynchronous operation encounters an error or fails. In this state, the promise returns an error or a reason for the failure.

A promise can be created using the `Promise` constructor, which takes a callback function with two parameters: `resolve` and `reject`. Inside this callback function, you perform the asynchronous operation and call either `resolve(value)` to fulfill the promise with a value or `reject(error)` to reject the promise with an error.

Once a promise is created, you can chain `then()` and `catch()` methods to handle the fulfillment or rejection of the promise. The `then()` method is called when the promise is fulfilled, and it takes a callback function that receives the fulfilled value as an argument. The `catch()` method is called when the promise is rejected, and it takes a callback function that receives the rejection reason as an argument.

Here's an example of using a promise in JavaScript:

```javascript
    function fetchData() {
      return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        setTimeout(() => {
          const data = 'Data received';
          resolve(data);
        }, 2000);
      });
    }
```
```javascript
    fetchData()
      .then((data) => {
        console.log(data); // Output: Data received
      })
      .catch((error) => {
        console.error(error);
      });
```

In the above example, the `fetchData()` function returns a promise that resolves with the value `'Data received'` after a delay of 2000 milliseconds. We chain the `then()` method to handle the fulfilled value and log it to the console. If an error occurs during the asynchronous operation, the `catch()` method is called to handle the rejection.

Promises provide a more structured and readable way to handle asynchronous code compared to traditional callbacks. They are widely used in JavaScript and are also supported in Angular for handling asynchronous operations, such as making HTTP requests or working with asynchronous APIs.

## async await

The async keyword is used to declare an asynchronous function, which automatically returns a promise. Within an async function, you can use the await keyword to pause the execution of the function until a promise is resolved or rejected. The await keyword can only be used inside an async function.

Here's an example to demonstrate the usage of async/await

```javascript
function fetchData() {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        setTimeout(() => {
            const data = 'Data received';
            resolve(data);
        }, 2000);
    });
}

async function getData() {
try {
        const result = await fetchData();
        console.log(result); // Output: Data received
    } catch (error) {
        console.error(error);
    }
}

getData();
```

## Variable Hoisting:

```javascript
    console.log(x); // Output: undefined
    var x = 5;
```

Even though the variable `x` is accessed before it is declared, it does not throw an error. This is because the declaration is hoisted to the top, resulting in `undefined` when accessed before the assignment.

## typeof null - object:

```javascript
    console.log(typeof null); // Output: object
```

The `typeof` operator returns "object" when used with `null`, which is considered a bug in JavaScript.

## Event Bubbling:

```html
    <div id="parent">
      <div id="child">
        <button id="button">Click me</button>
      </div>
    </div>
```

```javascript
document.getElementById("button").addEventListener("click", function(event) {
    console.log("Button clicked");
    event.stopPropagation(); // Stop event bubbling
});

document.getElementById("child").addEventListener("click", function() {
    console.log("Child clicked");
});

document.getElementById("parent").addEventListener("click", function() {
    console.log("Parent clicked");
});
```
    
When the button is clicked, the event bubbles up from the child element to the parent element. Without `event.stopPropagation()`, all three event listeners would be triggered, resulting in the following output:    
```
    Button clicked
    Child clicked
    Parent clicked
```

## Object Mutation:

```javascript
    var person = {
      name: "John",
      age: 30
    };

    person.age = 31;
    console.log(person); // Output: { name: "John", age: 31 }

    person.city = "New York";
    console.log(person); // Output: { name: "John", age: 31, city: "New York" }
```
    
The properties of the `person` object can be modified after it is created by directly assigning new values to them.

## Object.freeze:

```javascript
    var person = {
      name: "John",
      age: 30
    };

    Object.freeze(person);

    person.age = 31; // Modification is silently ignored
    console.log(person); // Output: { name: "John", age: 30 }

    person.city = "New York"; // Addition is silently ignored
    console.log(person); // Output: { name: "John", age: 30 }
```

`Object.freeze()` prevents any modifications to the `person` object, making it read-only.

## Spread Operators:

```javascript
    var arr1 = [1, 2, 3];
    var arr2 = [4, 5, 6];

    var combinedArray = [...arr1, ...arr2];
    console.log(combinedArray); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

    var obj1 = { name: "John" };
    var obj2 = { age: 30 };

    var mergedObject = { ...obj1, ...obj2 };
    console.log(mergedObject); // Output: { name: "John", age: 30 }
```
The spread operator (`...`) is used to combine the elements of arrays or merge the properties of objects.

## Object.keys:

```javascript
    var person = {
      name: "John",
      age: 30,
      city: "New York"
    };

    var keys = Object.keys(person);
    console.log(keys); // Output: ["name", "age", "city"]
```

`Object.keys()` returns an array of property names of the `person` object. In this case, it returns `["name", "age", "city"]`.


## Observable

The Observable is a class provided by the RxJS library, which is commonly used in Angular applications. It represents a stream of data or events over time.

The Observable class provides methods and operators to create, transform, and manipulate these streams of data. It allows you to handle asynchronous operations, such as making HTTP requests, handling user input, or processing data from various sources.

When you create an Observable object, you define the behavior of the stream, including how and when data is emitted, how errors are handled, and when the stream completes. The Observable class provides methods like next(), error(), and complete() to control the behavior of the stream.

the Observable class in Angular allows you to work with asynchronous data streams and provides a powerful way to handle and manipulate these streams using various operators and methods provided by the RxJS library.

```javascript
  // Example method returning an Observable
  public getData(): Observable<string> {
    return new Observable((observer) => {
      // Simulating an asynchronous operation
      setTimeout(() => {
        // Emitting a value
        observer.next('Data received');

        // Completing the Observable
        observer.complete();
      }, 2000);
    });
  }
```

## Subject

A subject is a type of observable that allows you to multicast a value or event to multiple subscribers.
Subjects are a fundamental part of the RxJS library, which is commonly used for handling asynchronous and event-based programming in JavaScript.

## BehaviorSubject

There are different types of subjects in RxJS, and one of them is the BehaviorSubject. 
A BehaviorSubject is a variant of the subject that stores the "current" value and emits it to new subscribers. 
It always holds the latest value, even if there are no subscribers at the moment. When a new subscriber subscribes to a BehaviorSubject, it immediately receives the last emitted value, or an initial value if no value has been emitted yet.
    
Here's an example to demonstrate the usage of a BehaviorSubject:
```javascript
    import { BehaviorSubject } from 'rxjs';

    const subject = new BehaviorSubject('Initial value');

    // Subscribe to the subject
    subject.subscribe((value) => {
      console.log('Subscriber 1:', value);
    });

    // Emit a new value
    subject.next('First value');

    // Subscribe to the subject again
    subject.subscribe((value) => {
      console.log('Subscriber 2:', value);
    });

    // Emit another value
    subject.next('Second value');
```

## directives, types, usages

## Angular Universal:

Angular Universal is a server-side rendering (SSR) solution for Angular applications. 
It allows you to render your application on the server and send the pre-rendered HTML to the client, improving the initial loading time and enabling search engine optimization (SEO). Angular Universal works by running your Angular application on a Node.js server and generating HTML on the server side, which is then sent to the client.

## Pipe Chaining:

Pipe chaining in Angular refers to the ability to apply multiple pipes consecutively to transform data in a template. By using the pipe operator (|), you can chain multiple pipes together to perform a series of transformations on a value. 
For example, you can chain the `uppercase` and `date` pipes to convert a string to uppercase and then format it as a date.

## Custom Pipe:

In Angular, a custom pipe allows you to create your own reusable transformation logic for data displayed in templates. 
Custom pipes are defined using the `@Pipe` decorator and implementing the `PipeTransform` interface. 
They can be used to format, filter, or transform data in various ways. Custom pipes can be applied in templates using the pipe operator (|) followed by the name of the custom pipe.

## Interceptor:

Interceptors in Angular are used to intercept HTTP requests and responses globally, allowing you to modify or handle them before they reach the server or the client. 
Interceptors are implemented by creating a class that implements the `HttpInterceptor` interface and providing custom logic in the `intercept` method. Interceptors can be used for tasks such as adding headers, handling errors, or modifying request/response data.

## Observer:

In the context of Angular and RxJS, an observer is an object that receives notifications from an Observable. Observers subscribe to Observables to receive values or events emitted by the Observable. Observers implement the `Observer` interface and provide custom logic for handling emitted values, errors, and completion notifications. The three main methods of an observer are `next`, `error`, and `complete`.

## Async Pipe:

The Async Pipe in Angular is a built-in pipe that simplifies the handling of asynchronous data streams, particularly Observables or Promises, in templates. 
The Async Pipe subscribes to an Observable or Promise and automatically updates the view with the latest emitted value. It also handles the unsubscribing process when the component is destroyed, preventing memory leaks. The Async Pipe is commonly used to display data that is fetched asynchronously from APIs or services directly in the template.
    
Using the Async Pipe eliminates the need for manual subscription management and simplifies the code, making it more readable and maintainable.

## Dependency Injection:

Dependency Injection is a design pattern used in software development to achieve loose coupling between components and improve code reusability. In the context of frameworks like Angular, it refers to the ability to inject dependencies (such as services or other components) into a class or component, rather than creating them directly within the class. This allows for better separation of concerns and easier testing.

## ng-container:

`ng-container` is a structural directive in Angular that provides a way to group multiple elements without adding an extra element to the DOM. It is useful when you need to apply structural directives like `ngIf` or `ngFor` to a group of elements without adding an extra wrapper element.

## Custom Directive:

In Angular, a custom directive is a reusable component-like feature that allows you to extend the functionality of HTML elements or components. Custom directives can be used to manipulate the DOM, add behavior, or modify the appearance of elements. They are defined using the `@Directive` decorator and can be applied to elements using attribute selectors.

## Form Types:

In Angular, there are different types of forms that can be used to handle user input and perform form validation. The main types are:
    
- Template-driven forms: These forms rely on directives and two-way data binding to handle form controls and validation. They are easier to set up but offer less control and flexibility compared to reactive forms.

- Reactive forms: These forms are based on reactive programming principles and use an explicit approach to handle form controls and validation. They provide more control and flexibility, making them suitable for complex forms and dynamic form scenarios.

## Sharing Data Between Components:

There are several ways to share data between components in Angular:
  
- Using @Input and @Output decorators: @Input allows a parent component to pass data to a child component, while @Output allows a child component to emit events to a parent component.

- Using a shared service: Components can communicate with each other through a shared service by injecting it into the components and using it to store and retrieve data.

- Using route parameters or query parameters: Components can share data by passing parameters through the URL using route parameters or query parameters.

- Using state management libraries: Libraries like NgRx or Akita can be used to manage application state and share data between components.

## router-outlet:

`router-outlet` is a directive in Angular that acts as a placeholder for dynamically loaded components based on the current route. It is used in the template of the component that represents the main container for routing in an Angular application. The router-outlet directive is responsible for rendering the appropriate component based on the current route configuration.

## AuthGuard:

AuthGuard is an implementation of the Angular `CanActivate` interface that is used to protect routes and control access to certain parts of an application. It allows you to define rules and conditions that must be met before a user can access a specific route. AuthGuard is commonly used for implementing authentication and authorization logic in Angular applications.

## Lifecycles:

In Angular, components have various lifecycle hooks that allow you to perform actions at different stages of a component's lifecycle. Some commonly used lifecycle hooks are:

- ngOnInit: Called after the component is initialized and its inputs have been set.
- ngOnChanges: Called when one or more input properties of a component change.
- ngOnDestroy: Called just before the component is destroyed and removed from the DOM.
- ngAfterViewInit: Called after the component's view has been fully initialized and rendered.
- ngAfterContentInit: Called after the component's content has been projected into the view.

These lifecycle hooks provide opportunities to perform actions such as initializing data, subscribing to observables, cleaning up resources, or interacting with the DOM at specific points in a component's lifecycle.

Sure! Here are examples for each of the concepts:
